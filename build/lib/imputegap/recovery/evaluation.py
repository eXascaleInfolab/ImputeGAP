    A class to evaluate the performance of imputation algorithms by comparing imputed time series with the ground truth.

    Methods
    -------
    metrics_computation():
        Compute various evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, MI, CORRELATION) for the imputation.
    compute_rmse():
        Compute the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the ground truth and the imputed values.
    compute_mae():
        Compute the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the ground truth and the imputed values.
    compute_mi():
        Compute the Mutual Information (MI) between the ground truth and the imputed values.
    compute_correlation():
        Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ground truth and the imputed values.
