All missing data patterns developed in ImputeGAP are available in the ``ts.patterns`` module.


.. _setup:

Setup
-----

    -   N = number of time series
    -   M = length of time series
    -   R = rate of missing values chosen by the user (%)
    -   O = offset of security in the beginning of the series (%)

    -   W = R * M (int)


.. _scenario_mono_block:

Scenarios MONO-BLOCK
--------------------

**Missing Percentage**

    -   N: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   M: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - O)% of the series length.
    -   The starting position begins at O and progresses until W is reached, affecting the first series from the top up to N% of the dataset.


**Missing Percentage At Random**

    -   N: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   M: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - O)% of the series length.
    -   The starting position is randomly shifted by adding a random value to O, then progresses until W is reached, affecting the first series from the top up to N% of the dataset.


**Disjoint**

    -   N: Ranges from 1 to max.
    -   M: Ranges from 1% to limit.
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - O)% of the series length.
    -   The starting position of the first missing block begins at O.
    -   Each subsequent missing block starts immediately after the previous one ends, continuing this pattern until the limit or M of the dataset is reached.


**Overlap**

    -   N: Ranges from 1 to max.
    -   M: Ranges from 1% to limit.
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - O)% of the series length.
    -   The starting position of the first missing block begins at O.
    -   Each subsequent missing block starts after the previous one ends, but with a shift back of S%, creating an overlap.
    -   This pattern continues until the limit or M is reached.

**Blackout**

    -   N: All series
    -   M: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - O)% of the series length.
    -   All series are affected identically, meaning the same missing pattern is applied across all series.


.. _scenario_multi_block:

Scenarios MULTI-BLOCK
---------------------

**MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)**

    -   N: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   M: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   Data is removed from random series at a random position between O and M, until a total of W of all time series data points are missing.
    -   Data is removed in blocks of a specific size.


**Gaussian**

    -   N: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   M: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   Data is removed following a Gaussian distribution for every values of M, affecting the first series from the top up to N% of the dataset.


**Distribution**

    -   N: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   M: Ranges from 1% to max.
    -   Data is removed following a distribution given by the user for every values of M, affecting the first series from the top up to N% of the dataset.
